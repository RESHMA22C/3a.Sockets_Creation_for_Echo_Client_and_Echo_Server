# 3a.CREATION FOR ECHO CLIENT AND ECHO SERVER USING TCP SOCKETS
# AIM
To write a python program for creating Echo Client and Echo Server using TCP
Sockets Links.
## ALGORITHM:
1. Import the necessary modules in python
2. Create a socket connection to using the socket module.
3. Send message to the client and receive the message from the client using the Socket module in
 server .
4. Send and receive the message using the send function in socket.
